Hi, I'm Melissa. I'm a web developer.

I began my adventures in programming when I decided to quit my job in 2012 to return to school. I earned an Associates in Computer Science before diving onto a programming bootcamp and refining my web developer skills.

My favorite language is Ruby, but I'm always down for learning new languages and frameworks.
